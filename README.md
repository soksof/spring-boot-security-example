This is a demo web application built with Spring boot and using:
- A MySQL database
- Spring Security for login
- The Thymeleaf template engine for MVC views

In the resources folder you can find the SQL file for creating the database. You must then change the connection properties (as well as the database name you used) in the application.properties file
